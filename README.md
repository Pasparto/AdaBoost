# AdaBoost
ML with python

My first step was to understand and translate this paper to hebrew (Section 2.1 - 2.3) including all the mathematical proofs and theorems:
https://www.lri.fr/~kegl/mlcourse/book.pdf

Second, I reproduced AdaBoost algorithm including all the graphs + benchmarks, following this blog:
https://geoffruddock.com/adaboost-from-scratch-in-python/

My final step is to change that Adaboost implementation and replace the Decision tree learner (AKA weak learner) with Logistic Regression learner.
